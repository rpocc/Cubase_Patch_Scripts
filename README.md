These are Cubase patch scripts which can be used for displaying names of presets in a MIDI device installed via MIDI Device Manager.
Such devices are generally used as external synthesizers with programs automatically recalled via MIDI program change uponh loading the project, or in my case, as external effect processors.

On my Windows DAW the user script folder is here: %appdata%\Roaming\Steinberg\Cubase 12_64\Scripts.
In your case the folder may be different but you can get the idea.
